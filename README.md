# MethylApp
Methylapp helps to identify methylations patterns inside baterian DNA.

This is a renew version from my Final Degree Project. The intention is to make it faster, not based on Django and make it a standalone application that takes care of all libraries and instalations on behalf of the investigator.
My idea is to make it as simple as possible and, at the same time, gain in efficiency and cleanliness.
